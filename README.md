# Welcome to Clear my Doubts App!!
Let me go get you through all the features that this app contains ðŸ˜€

1) Auth Screens
You can either Register or Login if you have an account already
while trying to fill in the details it will display all the errors if any. For Ex:- Email should be valid, Password should be strong etc
All these screens have a strong validation check without which you cannot proceed.

2) Home Screen
=> You have a profile icon , over which if you click you can see all your details, all the posts that you have created and a logout button if you wish to exit.
=> There is an Ask me Doubt button which when clicked takes you to a different screen where you can give a title and description to the doubt you want to ask.
=> In the middle of the screen you can see all questions asked by others sorted by most recent.
=> you can click on any of the post, which when clicked will take you to a screen which displays the entire content of the question asked, and all the replies from other people
